The problem

In business meetings, classrooms, family discussions, and customer service, valuable insights and decisions are often lost or misunderstood because there is no real-time way to capture, understand, and analyze live conversations. People struggle to remember key points, miss out on actionable suggestions, and lack an unbiased assistant to provide context-aware feedback. In Nigeria and globally, this leads to inefficiency, miscommunication, and lost opportunities for improvement in both professional and personal settings.

The need

There is a growing demand for tools that can listen to live conversations, understand the context, and provide instant, intelligent feedback. Organizations and individuals want to capture knowledge, summarize discussions, and receive actionable insights in real time. With the rise of remote work, global teams, and digital collaboration, the need for AI-powered conversation intelligence is more urgent than ever. Privacy, ethical listening, and local data processing are also critical requirements for adoption.

Our solution

Contexta is a web-based platform that uses advanced AI to listen to live conversations, transcribe them in real time, and provide context-aware voice or text responses on demand. Users can ask the AI for summaries, suggestions, or nuanced options during any discussion. The system is designed for business meetings, education, family decisions, customer service, and more. It runs in the browser, requires no installation, and ensures privacy by processing data locally or temporarily. Contexta is scalable, fast, and easy to deploy, with a roadmap for advanced features like speaker identification, document knowledge injection, and multilingual support.

The market

The global conversation intelligence market is projected to reach over 43 billion USD by 2030, growing at a CAGR of more than 20%. In Nigeria, the digital transformation of businesses and education is accelerating, with over 122 million internet users and a rapidly growing remote workforce. The demand for AI-powered productivity tools is rising across Africa, with businesses, schools, and families seeking solutions for better communication and decision-making. Key sectors include enterprise collaboration, education technology, customer service, and healthcare. According to Statista and Grand View Research, the global speech and voice recognition market alone is expected to surpass 53 billion USD by 2030, with Africa representing a high-growth region due to mobile-first adoption and increasing digital literacy.

Business model

Contexta will operate on a SaaS subscription model for businesses and educational institutions, with tiered pricing based on usage, features, and number of users. There will be a free tier for individuals and small teams with limited features, and premium plans for advanced AI, analytics, and integrations. Additional revenue streams include API access for developers, white-label solutions for enterprises, and future integration with blockchain for secure conversation verification and tokenized features.

Competitive advantage

Contexta offers real-time, context-aware AI feedback with a focus on privacy, ethical listening, and local data processing. The platform is lightweight, browser-based, and easy to deploy, making it accessible to organizations of all sizes. The nuanced options feature provides richer, more inclusive decision support than traditional binary AI responses. Contexta’s modular architecture allows rapid integration of new AI models, languages, and features, ensuring long-term adaptability and innovation.

Competitors

Local competitors in Nigeria include VoiceIT Africa, Turing Technologies, and local call center analytics providers. Globally, major competitors are Gong, Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Chorus.ai, and Microsoft Teams’ conversation intelligence features. However, most global solutions are focused on enterprise sales and lack deep localization, privacy-first design, and nuanced decision support tailored for African markets.

Scalability

Contexta is built on a scalable, cloud-native architecture using React, Node.js, and modular AI services. The platform can support thousands of concurrent users and is designed for rapid deployment in new markets. Future upgrades include a Go-based microservice for high-performance audio streaming, integration with blockchain for secure and auditable conversation records, and expansion into multilingual and mobile-first experiences. The system is structured to evolve into a world-class collaboration and communication intelligence suite for Africa and beyond.
